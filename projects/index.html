HTML DEVELOPMENT

-(step 1): Brainstorming

	In the beginning, my experience in html was nonexistent and I needed
to consider research from w3schools and gaining insight from previous work.
such would allow me to create the foundation and formula to create my
own website.

-(step 2): Stage and Design

	Creating the website gave me an understanding with the html langauge
and provide an insight to how other website development languauges would 
function. I understand that the framework is based in a beginning <!--<hr>-->
and conclude with <!--</hr>-->.

-(step 3): Networking and applying

	Attaching the html page to my local host and transfering to github
shows how the transfer of such important data is built around business.
Github prides itself to help transfer and finish webistes such as mine

-(step 4): Polishing

	Going though the code and refining such to fix errors and decorate 
is satisfying and proper. There are many opportunities for code once the 
framework is finished and certain possiblities are by the boundless

-(step 5): Concluding

	Cleaning the HTML code and applying it to a website may be seen as
practical considering that information can be organixed and sugarcoated.
This project has been considerably enlightening and enjoyable overall.
